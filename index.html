    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Monica. I graduated from Iowa State University in 2018 with a Bachelor's of Science
            in Technical Communication. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In the age of tech, you see a lot of complex information out there. As a technical communicator, it's my job to do the behind-the-scenes
            work of deconstructing verbose scientific and engineering jargon and turn it into clear, concise content for the masses.</p>
        
        <p>It's a skill that many companies unfortunately look over despite its ability to drastically improve customer satisfaction. When a product 
           has truly helpful resources (documentation, training videos, brochures), customers are more likely to repeat business because they know
           that the company has invested in the infrastructure to help them.
        </p>   
        
        <p>
           This opportunity to not only help people, but also the companies themselves (big or small), is what drove me to love Technical Communication.
        </p>
